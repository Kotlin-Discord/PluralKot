# PluralKot: v1.0.0

This is the initial release for this project, which is a simple coroutine-based wrapper around the PluralKit HTTP
API.

This project needs testing, and there will be teething issues and changes as we go. If you have use-cases that this
project would help with, please test it out and let us know how you get on!
